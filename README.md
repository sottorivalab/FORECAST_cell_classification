# FORECAST Cell Classification Pipeline

This repository contains the code for the whole slide image cell classification pipeline used in the paper *Tumor evolution metrics predict recurrence beyond 10 years in locally advanced prostate cancer* by Fernandez-Mateos, Cresswell, Trahearn, *et al*.

Included are scripts for both cell detection and classification on a whole slide image, as well as scripts for training the models.
