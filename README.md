# FORECAST_cell_classification

This repository contains the code for the semantic segmentation pipeline used to perform Gleason segmentation of whole slide images in the paper *Tumour evolvability metrics predict recurrence beyond 10 years in locally-advanced prostate cancer* by Fernandez-Mateos, Cresswell, Trahearn, *et al*.

Included are scripts for both cell detection and classification on a whole slide image, as well as scripts for training the models.
