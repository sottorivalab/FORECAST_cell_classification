% EstUsingSCD: Estimate the stain separation matrix using the Stain Colour
%              Descriptor method
% 
%
% Input:
% I                  - RGB input image.
% TrainingStruct     - (optional) A struct containing the trained stain
%                      classifier. If the structure is not provided then 
%                      the built-in Random Forest Classifier is used.
%
%
% Output:
% M                  - Stain separation matrix with columns corresponding
%                      to stain vectors.
% Labels             - A label image showing the results of classification.
