function [ Hist ] = GenerateHistogram( Image, Pallet )

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% GenerateHistogram: Generates a histogram of colours, with respect to 
%                    the input colour pallet.
%
% Input:
% Image                 - RGB input image.
% Pallet                - An nx6 matrix, where each row defines a colour in
%                         the pallet.
%
%
% Output:
% Hist                  - The colour pallet histogram. An nx1 vector, where
%                         each entry is the count for the number of pixels
%                         from the input Image that correspond to the given 
%                         colour in Pallet.
%
%
% Notes: Both Image and Pallet must be uint8s.
%
%        The format of a row (or colour) in Pallet is:
%        [R_Start R_End G_Start G_End B_Start B_End]
%        Where R_Start is the smallest value in the red channel accepted as
%        this colour, and R_End is the largest, the remaining entries are
%        the same for the green and blue channels, respectively.
%        These define the range of RGB values that are considered to be the
%        same colour in the pallet.
